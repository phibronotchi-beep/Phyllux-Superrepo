## Executive Summary

Phyllux Wave, a golden-angle fractal antenna array technology using non-periodic element placement, may provide significant advantages for SpaceX's Starlink satellite constellation systems. Our golden-angle spiral antenna arrays are designed to reduce grating lobes and may improve beamforming compared to regular phased arrays.

**Key Advantages:**
- Non-periodic antenna element placement may reduce grating lobes
- Scalable to large arrays (10-10,000+ elements)
- Public prior art established (January 7, 2026)
- PPA filing in progress (late January 2026)

## Executive Summary

Phyllux Mesh, a phyllotactic neural meshing technology using non-periodic electrode arrays, may provide significant advantages for Neuralink's brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Our 121-electrode phyllotactic layout is designed to minimize crosstalk between channels and may improve signal quality compared to regular grid arrays.

**Key Advantages:**
- Non-periodic electrode spacing may reduce crosstalk
- Scalable Fibonacci-based counts (13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 121, 144, etc.)
- Public prior art established (January 7, 2026)
- PPA filing in progress (late January 2026)

### Stage 1: Conceptual Identification
- Identify promising fusion concept
- Review OPPORTUNITY_MATRIX.md for scoring
- Assess market potential
- Determine tier alignment

### Stage 2: Derived Analysis
- Apply core technology to new domain
- Conduct preliminary analysis
- Identify key technical challenges
- Document in phyllux-inventions-wip

### Stage 3: Simulation
- Develop simulation models
- Validate key assumptions
- Analyze performance characteristics
- Update maturity tag to Simulated

### Stage 4: Structural Design
- Create detailed specifications
- Design structural models
- Plan validation approach
- Update maturity tag to Structural

### Stage 5: Candidate Validation
- Build prototypes (if applicable)
- Validate performance
- Prepare for production
- Update maturity tag to Candidate

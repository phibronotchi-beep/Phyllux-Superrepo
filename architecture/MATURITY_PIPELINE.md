## Maturity Levels

1. **Conceptual (1-2/10):** Early-stage ideas, theoretical exploration
2. **Derived (3-4/10):** Derived from core technologies, preliminary analysis
3. **Simulated (5-6/10):** Simulation results, validated models
4. **Structural (7-8/10):** Structural designs, detailed specifications
5. **Candidate (9-10/10):** Production-ready candidates, validated prototypes

## Progression Path

![Maturity Progression](visuals/architecture/maturity-progression.svg)

**Conceptual → Derived:**
- Apply core technology to new domain
- Preliminary analysis
- Identify key challenges

**Derived → Simulated:**
- Develop simulation models
- Validate key assumptions
- Analyze performance

**Simulated → Structural:**
- Design detailed specifications
- Create structural models
- Plan validation

**Structural → Candidate:**
- Build prototypes
- Validate performance
- Prepare for production

## Current Distribution

**High Priority (Structural/Candidate):**
- Fusion 234: Mesh + BCIs (Structural, 7/10)
- Fusion 241: Mesh + Neuroprosthetics (Structural, 7/10)
- [Additional high-maturity fusions]

**Medium Priority (Simulated):**
- Fusion 115: Wave + Satellites (Simulated, 5/10)
- Fusion 125: Wave + 5G/6G (Simulated, 5/10)
- [Additional simulated fusions]

**Low Priority (Conceptual/Derived):**
- [Most fusions in conceptual/derived stage]
- Focus on advancing high-priority fusions

## Advancement Strategy

**Short-Term (12-24 months):**
- Advance Structural fusions to Candidate
- Validate Simulated fusions
- Focus on high-priority opportunities

**Medium-Term (24-48 months):**
- Advance Simulated fusions to Structural
- Validate Derived fusions
- Expand commercial opportunities

**Long-Term (48+ months):**
- Advance Conceptual fusions
- Explore new domains
- Build comprehensive pipeline

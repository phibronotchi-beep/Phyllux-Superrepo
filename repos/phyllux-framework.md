# phyllux-framework Repository

**GitHub:** https://github.com/phibronotchi-beep/phyllux-framework  
**Purpose:** Governance, licensing, and ethical framework  
**Established:** January 20, 2026

## Overview

This repository defines the ethical and governance framework for the Phyllux ecosystem. It establishes the 4-tier licensing model, documents the method spine, and provides templates for partner engagement.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Contains NO code (documentation only)
- Contains NO IP claims (references biomimetic-inventions-public for prior art)
- Public-facing (anyone can view)
- Defines ethical boundaries and governance structure

## 4-Tier Licensing Model

### Tier 1: Pioneer
**Mission-Critical, Exclusive Partnerships**

**Characteristics:**
- Exclusive licensing (typically)
- Mission-critical applications
- High-value partnerships
- Examples: Tier 1 BCI, Tier 1 satellite

**Use Cases:**
- Technologies that could transform entire industries
- Partnerships with major players in target markets
- Applications requiring significant investment and commitment

**Terms:**
- Negotiated per partnership
- Typically includes exclusivity
- Higher licensing fees
- Strategic collaboration

---

### Tier 2: Mission-Aligned
**Non-Exclusive, Mission-Driven Partnerships**

**Characteristics:**
- Non-exclusive licensing
- Mission-driven organizations
- Climate tech, medical research, education
- Examples: Climate tech startups, medical research institutions

**Use Cases:**
- Technologies aligned with positive social impact
- Organizations with clear mission statements
- Applications that benefit society broadly

**Terms:**
- Negotiated per partnership
- Typically non-exclusive
- Lower licensing fees (mission discount)
- Collaboration on shared goals

---

### Tier 3: Commercial
**Standard Commercial Licensing**

**Characteristics:**
- Standard commercial terms
- Broad market access
- Competitive pricing
- Examples: Antenna manufacturers, electronics companies

**Use Cases:**
- Standard commercial applications
- Broad market deployment
- Competitive industries
- General-purpose technologies

**Terms:**
- Standard licensing agreements
- Market-rate fees
- Non-exclusive (typically)
- Standard IP protections

---

### Tier 4: Free
**Research and Open Source Access**

**Characteristics:**
- Free access for research
- Open source compatible
- MIT license for code (from biomimetic-inventions-public)
- Examples: Academic researchers, open source projects

**Use Cases:**
- Academic research
- Open source projects
- Educational purposes
- Non-commercial exploration

**Terms:**
- Free access
- MIT license (code)
- CC BY-SA 4.0 (documentation)
- Attribution required

## Method Spine Documentation

**PHYLUX_SPINE.md** documents the unifying principle:

**The Golden Angle (137.508°):**
- Derived from golden ratio: φ ≈ 1.618
- Mathematical relationship: 360° / φ² ≈ 137.508°
- Applied across all core technologies
- Provides non-periodic layout advantages

**Key Points:**
- Method spine is the core innovation
- Individual technologies are applications
- Cross-domain integration is a key advantage
- Prior art established in biomimetic-inventions-public

---

## Maturity Framework

**DISCLOSURE.md** defines maturity levels:

1. **Conceptual (1-2/10):** Early-stage ideas, theoretical exploration
2. **Derived (3-4/10):** Derived from core technologies, preliminary analysis
3. **Simulated (5-6/10):** Simulation results, validated models
4. **Structural (7-8/10):** Structural designs, detailed specifications
5. **Candidate (9-10/10):** Production-ready candidates, validated prototypes

**Qualified Language Required:**
- "may provide"
- "designed to"
- "simulations suggest"
- "could enable"
- "appears to"

**Never Use:**
- "guarantees"
- "proven"
- "definitely"
- Absolute performance claims

---

## Ethical Boundaries

**What We Won't License:**
- Weapons systems
- Surveillance without consent
- Technologies that harm individuals or groups
- Applications that violate human rights

**Mission Alignment:**
- Technologies that benefit society
- Applications that improve quality of life
- Research that advances human knowledge
- Open source and educational use

---

## Templates

**Tier-Specific Templates:**
- Pioneer tier engagement template
- Mission-Aligned tier engagement template
- Commercial tier engagement template
- Research tier engagement template

**Purpose:**
- Standardize partner engagement
- Ensure consistent messaging
- Maintain ethical boundaries
- Streamline negotiations

---

## Governance Structure

**Decision-Making:**
- David Edward Sproule: Final authority on licensing decisions
- Framework provides guidelines, not rigid rules
- Case-by-case evaluation for partnerships
- Ethical review for all tier assignments

**Updates:**
- Framework evolves based on experience
- Community input considered (for Tier 4)
- Ethical boundaries are non-negotiable
- Licensing terms negotiated per partnership
